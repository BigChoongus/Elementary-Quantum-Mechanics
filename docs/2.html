<h1 id="chapter-2-the-stern-gerlach-experiment">Chapter 2: The Stern
Gerlach Experiment</h1>
<p>In the Exoskeleton to this book, I presented the idea of modelling
very explicitly to the reader, because I think that a more authoritative
overview on the <em>procedure</em> of what we are trying to do is
important and often neglected by compendium-style textbooks. Considering
this is a mathematics textbook, we have opened up with a whole lot of
words. However, this is, to my estimation, the best way, and the result
is that the reader should get a ‘bird’s-eye’ view of the subject which
will be a helpful guide throughout, before we open the algebra and our
horizons immediately become narrowed down for some time.<br />
<br />
To complete our ‘bird’s-eye’ view over quantum mechanics, then, we will
now investigate one of the radical experiments of the early 20’s which
necessitated the birth of quantum mechanics to take the mantle from a
classical model which was suddenly proven woefully inadequate. I have
chosen the Stern Gerlach experiment, involving electron deflection in a
magnetic field. Other practical experiments, such as the Davisson-Germer
modification of Young’s Double Slit or the Mach-Zehnder Inferometer, are
also often used as opening preludes to the quantum model, but the Stern
Gerlach experiment is amongst these the easiest-accessible exhibition of
the phenomena we will be trying to mathematically model, without much
additional Physics knowledge required. What we herein are trying to
understand is what exactly the demands– from physical reality– quantum
mechanics had to meet were. It is a model, and models are valuable only
based on how well they meet the demands of the predictions they need to
be capable of making. With these extraordinary experimental results,
quantum mechanics very much was given a deeply challenging and novel set
of demands, so its rules – the Postulates – can be said to be directly
motivated by them.<br />
<br />
Thus, understanding these motivations provides a stabilising force of
unification between the otherwise unexplainable haphazard mathematical
abstractions which will follow. The author strongly suggests
understanding Planck’s (discretised) solution to the blackbody radiation
problem, Bohr’s new atom model, Young’s double slit experiment, De
Broglie’s matter waves, and Born’s radical idea of “probability clouds"
before beginning to read this book. These need not be learned out of
textbooks or with any length or depth of study at all– only the most
superficial familiarity with the concepts is needed– but are very useful
to have a basic grasp of in order to understand what new issues quantum
mechanics had to address when it was conceived. We cannot cover all the
above physics experiments in any true detail, because doing so not only
violates the mathematical focus of this book– dissipating the reader’s
attention with phenomenological distractions– but also requires far more
complex physics than can fit into this textbook.<br />
<br />
Now, then, if the reader feels introduced to the ideas of inherent
probability and superposition, we will press on with a very concrete
example to see these principles in real world practice.</p>
<h2 id="the-stern-gerlach-experiment">The Stern-Gerlach experiment</h2>
<p>The idea of inherent probability has been introduced and is well
covered even by non-mathematical media on quantum mechanics. If the
reader has familiarised themselves with these background ideas of
inherent probability, we can investigate this further, and the
consequences it has on the quantum state, by turning to the
Stern-Gerlach experiment. The reason this experiment is so useful is
because it allows us to focus on a particular <em>observable</em>– that
is, something we measure in an experiment– which can only take two
possible values. This allows greater lucidity in how we organise a
systematic investigation into the strange quantum mechanical phenomena
of probabilities.<br />
<br />
The setup deals with the magnetic properties of silver (Ag) electrons.
Specifically, we consider what happens when we pass them through a
magnetic field. What we expect is for deflection to occur; this is due
to a property of electrons, called spin, which is directly influenced by
the magnetic moment exerted on the electrons by the magnetic field. A
problem with spin is that it has no classical analogue- that is, we have
not seen any such quality with our own eyes in our macroscopic world;
indeed, the physicist Pauli describes spin as something ‘not describable
classically’. Nevertheless, all the reader needs to know is that this
quality determines the different ways an electron is deflected by the
magnetic field, and that it is a measurable quality. We can reduce each
electron to be considered as a single point particle with a particular
spin, by performing some net cancellations. So we will make that
assumption that the particles we are working with in the experiment are
single point particles with some spin values.<br />
<br />
Now, after electrons are deflected by this magnetic field, they are
detected by an electron detector on the other side, which we can
visualise as a simple screen which shows where the electrons land. The
expectation classically is that there is a large patch of electrons
formed on the detector screen, bounded by the furthest deflections
achieved (and possible) during the experiment. This is because we expect
that spin is some continuous value which may differ from electron to
electron, resulting in slightly different respective deflections by the
magnetic field: thus forming in this patch on the detector screen.<br />
<br />
However, the results which are achieved are rather different. There are
only two positions at which electrons are detected after deflection on
the screen. If we proffer that this quality of spin is the only facet
which changes the deflection– other than the magnetic field, which is
the same for every electron passing through it and constant throughout–
then this necessarily means we have observed the <em>quantisation</em>
of spin: the property of an observable having a finite set of discrete
values– here, two. There are two possible deflections, and therefore
there must be two possible spins given that nothing else is
changing.<br />
<br />
In the above we could have made a subtle semantic adjustment and said:
“there are two possible deflections, and so the electrons must have one
of two possible spins before passing through the magnetic field". We
will show that, while this might seem sensible to classical intuition,
it is in fact impossible for us to say this because it is impossible for
an electron to have a specific value of spin before passing through the
magnetic field! This is a dramatic statement, because under classical
intuition every object we study must have some value for any observable
at all times. We can change the momentum of a baseball by striking it,
but that doesn’t mean it did not have a momentum before we struck it and
measured the result. Somehow, quantum mechanics tells us that with spin,
the electron can exhibit a certain spin value after it passes through
the magnetic field, but does not necessarily have one before it does so.
This is a prime example of purely quantum behaviour, and was indeed why
the Stern Gerlach experiment, which strongly suggests this fact, was so
seminal as one of the experiments which necessitated the birth of
quantum mechanics.<br />
<br />
To understand how the results of the experiment show us this strange
behaviour must exist, we will engage in some sort of proof by
contradiction. We will assume the opposite is true: that the electron
must have a spin value at all times, and show that the results of the
experiment lead to a contradiction if this assumption is true. By doing
this, we will thereby prove our assumption is incompatible with the
results of experiment, and that therefore the electron cannot in fact
have a spin value at all times.<br />
<br />
In our work, we will focus on the two-dimensional Stern-Gerlach
experiment. The primary dimension we focus on will be the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-dimension– or, as we will think of it,
the “vertical" direction. Here, the two possible spins in our experiment
are “up spin", and “down spin". More interesting things come when we
consider a second dimension, so we will use the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-dimension as our secondary dimension,
where the two spins are “right spin", and “left spin". Corresponding to
these dimensions there are the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-dimension magnetic fields and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-dimension magnetic fields, which
deflect electrons in those dimensions alone.<br />
<br />
Let us now take our classical assumption on until we reach a
contradiction: we will assume that the electron must already have some
value of spin before passing through the magnetic field. Thus begins our
proof by contradiction.<br />
<br />
Let us first consider the purposes of the magnetic fields. It might seem
like they are performing a physical action on the electrons- which they
are: they are deflecting them. However, the real purpose of the magnetic
fields in this experiment is to <em>reveal</em> the spin value of
electrons which we assume they possess. By passing a single electron
through the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-dimension magnetic
field it is either deflected down, if it had down spin, or it is
deflected up, if it had up spin. In this way, the action is of passing
an Ag electron through the magnetic field is the action of measuring the
spin it has, because we reveal the spin through observing the direction
of deflection.<br />
<br />
The second quality of the magnetic field is that it separates a group of
electrons into two new groups corresponding to the two possible spins in
its dimension. Note that it can do both of these functions at the same
time: it deflects down spin electrons down and up spin electrons up,
which both splits them into distinguishable groups, and measures
(reveals) their spin. After passing a random beam of electrons through
the magnetic field, we will get these two resulting groups split by
their initial spin: surely, a useful thing to have.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, then we expect successive <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-dimension magnetic fields to yield a
clear result when applied to a group of electrons. The first <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-dimension magnet separates the group of
electrons into electrons with up spin and electrons with down spin.
Suppose we allow for enough distance to distinguish the two separate
deflections of up and down, and place two new magnetic fields at that
distance, one in the up deflection position, and one in the down
deflection position. Then, we therefore expect the second layer of
magnetic fields to perform the same measurement function, but with
different results since the original magnetic field originally separated
the inital beam into two groups based on the two possible spins.
Specifically, the second <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-dimension magnetic field in the
up-deflected position should measure all its electrons to have up spin,
and the second <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-dimension magnet
in the down-deflection position should measure all its electrons to have
down spin. This is of course because they have already been separated
into two distinct groups and measuring the spin of all the electrons in
those distinct groups will only yield one result, under our assumption
that the electrons hold a spin value at all times. We did not know the
spin value of the electrons before we passed them through the first
magnetic field, but after we do all our revelations are done.<br />
<br />
This is indeed what we achieve when we do actually perform the
experiment. The first <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-dimension
magnet splits a group of electrons into two groups corresponding to each
spin, and an infinite succession of <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-dimension magnetic fields on each of
these deflected trajectories will continue to measure the same spin by
continuing to deflect them in the same direction. The same holds for
successive <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-dimension magnetic
fields: the first separates the electrons into two groups with left and
right spin respectively, and the subsequent magnetic fields will
continue to measure the same spins if applied successively along the two
initial trajectories obtained by the first magnet.<br />
<br />
Of course, physicists were more inspired than just applying the same
magnetic field over and over again on the same electrons. We might
wonder what would happen if we applied some sequence of <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> magnetic fields. Let us note that
electrons passing through a magnetic field in a certain dimension are
not deflected in anyway in any other dimension. We implicitly see this
in the fact that electrons passing through the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> magnetic field follow a straight
trajectory with respect to the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-dimension and therefore still all hit
the detector screen a certain <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
distance away from the field.<br />
<br />
Our assumption is that an electron at all times holds a value for its
spin. We therefore also posit that an electron may at one time hold two
simultaneous properties of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> spin
and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin, which are independent
of each other: just like a ball may have a <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> axis momentum value and an <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> axis momentum value at the same time.
We test the relationship between the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spins of an electron: is an up spin
electron more likely to be a right spin electron, for example?
Understandings like this are physically relevant, of course- if a
electron passing through ‘unbiased’ magnetic fields was more likely to
be deflected right and up or left and down then this would surely have
physical implications.<br />
<br />
Suppose we isolate a certain <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-spin
and only consider electrons with that <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-spin: say, up spin. To do this
experimentally is simple– pass a group of electrons through a <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-magnetic field, give sufficient
distance for the deflected trajectories to diverge, and block the
down-deflected path so that none of those electrons can keep moving
forwards and the only ones moving forwards are the up spin electrons.
Let us suppose we did this. Then, we can investigate what happens when
we place an <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic field in the
path of the up-deflected electrons. The point of blocking out the
down-deflected electrons in this way is to assure us we will past this
point never have to deal with down spin electrons during our
considerations.<br />
<br />
The <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic field on any
ensemble of electrons will not show considerable bias towards any spin,
in fact. We obtain two new deflected trajectories, therefore: up-left
and up-right. Again, this all seems good, until we add another <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> magnetic field, after which a bizarre
phenomenon occurs.<br />
<br />
If we add another <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> magnetic field
to the trajectory of the up spin electrons which we have just deflected
left or right with the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> magnetic
field, we would expect all the electrons to be deflected upwards, since
these are after all electrons with up spin. We know that we have blocked
out all the down spin electrons far back, so they cannot escape to
intervene with the results of our current experiment.<br />
<br />
Such is not the case. What we get instead is that both the up-left and
up-right ensembles of electrons have subgroups of electrons which are
deflected downwards by the new <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>
magnet! This by all means should absolutely be impossible, given we have
filtered out all the down spin electrons already. Clearly, something is
wrong.<br />
<br />
To keep track of everything following this revelation, we will use a new
notation: <span class="math inline">\(\uspin\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\dspin\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\lspin\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\rspin\)</span> for different spins, as well as
two-fold notations such as <span class="math inline">\(\urspin\)</span>
to record when an electron has had its <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> spin measured. This is in a sense a
crude version of a ‘state notation’, as we are attempting to label the
state of a given electron– at least with respect to its spin properties.
The reason this is so useful is, among other things, simply that it
saves us a lot of time by avoiding having to write “up-right spin
electron" all the time.<br />
<br />
This state denotation model is just some arbitrary and meaningless
labelling, so one should not carried away with its importance other than
for making things more concise. Nevertheless, let’s take this state
denotation one final step further by adding scalars to the mix.
Specifically, we will use scalars to show how many electrons are in each
state for a given set. For example, we could have <span
class="math display">\[1000\elec=500\uspin + 500\dspin.\]</span> That
is: we have some 1000 electrons, 500 of which are up spin and 500 of
which are down spin. Similarly, we could say <span
class="math display">\[500\uspin = 250\ulspin + 250\urspin\]</span> or
even, <span class="math display">\[500\uspin \implies 250\ulspin +
250\urspin + 0\dlspin + 0\drspin.\]</span> That is, out of some sample
of 500 up spin electrons, we have measured 250 to have up left spin and
250 to have up right spin. We can use the <span
class="math inline">\(\implies\)</span> arrow to show that there is a
change after we place the electrons in a magnetic field. With this
interlude we can now clearly express what is strange about our above
result again– given our original classical assumption– by tracking what
information was revealed <u>after</u> each step:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pass the electron beam through a <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-magnetic field: <span
class="math display">\[1000\elec \implies 500\uspin+500\dspin\]</span>
assuming we start with 1000 electrons and the sample is indeed
random.</p></li>
<li><p>Block out the down-deflected channel: <span
class="math display">\[500\elec \implies 500\uspin+0\dspin\]</span>
reflecting that we now have 500 electrons since 500 down spin electrons
have all been blocked out from the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>Pass the electron beam through an <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic field: <span
class="math display">\[500\elec
\implies500\uspin+0\dspin=250\ulspin+250\ulspin+0\dspin\]</span>
assuming again an equal distribution which is experimentally
realistic.</p></li>
<li><p>Block the left spin channel. <span
class="math display">\[250\elec\implies0\ulspin+ 250\urspin +
0\dspin\]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, pass the electron beam through a <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-magnetic field. <span
class="math display">\[250\urspin\implies125\uspin+125\dspin\]</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The scalars themselves are really not important at all: one needn’t
think about numbers of electrons, as they are irrelevant in these
scenarios. What is relevant is what happens if we track what happens to
the <span class="math inline">\(\dspin\)</span> count between these
above steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(500\dspin\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0\dspin\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0\dspin\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(0\dspin\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(125\dspin\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>We have followed one single trajectory! So we should not be counting
500, 0, 0, 0, 125 unless down spin electrons have materialised out of
thin air (this is impossible, rest assured). We might therefore guess
that some of the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> counts are
false. We can consider this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In step 2, we have just blocked out all the down-spin electrons.
The 0 count surely therefore must be accurate.</p></li>
<li><p>In step 3, we have just passed the electron beam through an <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic field. We might offer 1
possible guess: that the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic
field actually influences the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-spin and that it is here therefore that
the subsequent 0 count was wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>In step 4, we blocked out all the left-spin electrons. If the 0
count here is false, that means that either blocking out left-spin
electrons switched the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-spin of
some of the electrons, or that there already were down spin electrons by
this point before we blocked out the left-spin electrons. If there were
down spin electrons before step 4 was implemented then this necessarily
means again that after step 3 the 0 count was already wrong.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So everything points to the only reasonable explanation being that
the 0 count after step 3 of the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic field was false: and this
would only occur if the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic
field actually flipped the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-spin
of some electrons. We first remember that the counter detector has only
actually measured the number of left spins and right spins after step 3,
since an <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic field does not
make any discernible <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-deflections.
So it is certainly true that if the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic field did flip some of the
electron <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-spins we would not have
detected this since it would not have manifested in a deflection.<br />
<br />
To test this one lifeline for our assumption, there is a cunning
modification to the apparatus. We recall that what we did originally was
place successive magnetic fields a relatively large distance away from
each other such that different deflected trajectories could be given
sufficient distances over which to diverge from each other and therefore
be discernibly different according to the measurements of detectors.
This makes sense if we simply consider the fact that we are considering
magnetic deflections of electrons, which are obviously not significant
at all in scale.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, we can also well imagine that we can let both
deflected paths pass through the same magnetic field, since the angle of
deflection is small. If we try this, we continue to add to the list of
complications. We can use our step by step denotation to track things
again:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pass the electron beam through a <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-magnetic field: <span
class="math display">\[1000\elec \implies500\uspin+500\dspin\]</span>
assuming we start with 1000 electrons and the sample is indeed
random.</p></li>
<li><p>Block out the down-deflected channel: <span
class="math display">\[500\elec \implies500\uspin+0\dspin\]</span>
reflecting that we now have 500 electrons since 500 down spin electrons
have all been blocked out from the experiment.</p></li>
<li><p>Pass the electron beam through an <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic field: <span
class="math display">\[500\elec=500\uspin+0\dspin\implies250\ulspin+250\urspin\]</span>
assuming again an equal distribution which is experimentally
realistic.</p></li>
<li><p>Pass both the up right and up left electrons through a new <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> magnetic field. <span
class="math display">\[500\elec=250\ulspin+ 250\urspin\implies
500\uspin\]</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>So if we compare the results of adding a new <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> magnetic field to the experiment (step
5 in the previous experiment and step 4 here):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If we remove one of the right or left channels of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-deflected electrons, then both up and
down channels emerge from the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-magnetic field applied to the remaining
beam.</p></li>
<li><p>If we keep both of the right and left channels, then only one
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> deflection emerges from the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-magnetic field applied to the remaining
beam.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The above effectively cancels out any idea that the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic field is flipping the <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin of some of the electrons. We had
guessed that in the first experiment that the reason why down spin
electrons were appearing seemingly out of nowhere (having been blocked
out, we thought, earlier) was because the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic field was flipping these
electrons. If this was the case, then adding left spin electrons would
not change anything, since the spin of one electron most definitely does
not effect the spin of another. Therefore, if the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> field really did flip electrons when
the left spin electrons were still absent, adding them would simply mean
we still have down spin electrons (perhaps more, since presumably some
left spin electrons would be flipped too if right spin electrons are).
Yet adding these left spin electrons eliminates rather than augments the
number of down spin electrons. Since the spin of one electron does not
affect the spin of another electron, we thereby infer our hypothesis
that an <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-magnetic field can flip a
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin is false.<br />
<br />
This now undoubtedly therefore suggests a problem with our original
assumption that an electron has pre-determined spin values, within which
there can be no explanation for certain empirically observed phenomena.
Therefore, the assumption that electrons have a spin value at all times
leads to a contradiction with empirical results and must be false.</p>
<h2 id="remodelling-the-stern-gerlach-experiment">Remodelling the Stern
Gerlach Experiment</h2>
<p>Within the next two chapters from this one, the exact reason for our
bizarre results will become quite clear. However, the gist is already
apparent: it seems like it is impossible for an electron to have
pre-determined spin values at every point in the experiment: and that
they only have pre-determined values at some very specific points in the
experiment. We need to ensure this could be consistent with experimental
data, so let us do this.<br />
<br />
One clue comes when we repeat the exact same experiment, but with <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
magnetic fields rather than <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> fields. The exact same set of phenomena
occurs, but simply with the sequence of spin dimensions switched around
to reflect the new sequence of magnetic fields. The explanation we now
proffer– which is finally the correct explanation– is that we cannot
know the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spins of the electrons simultaneously.
This is obviously not a classical explanation, and is our first
experience of a quantum phenomenon in action- that there can be
observables which cannot simultaneously both hold values for a given
state was certainly shocking to physicists of that time and should be
equally shocking to us.<br />
<br />
This does however, become consistent with all the phenomena we have been
getting in the experiments explained. When we have both left and right
channels going into the same magnet, out from the magnet emerges one
single channel (in our case, up). This is because, when both channels
enter the same magnetic field we can’t tell which of them have left and
which of them have right spin– and therefore we can tell afterwards what
their <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin is. However, if we
pass only one <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-deflected channel
through the magnet, then we can tell what the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> spin of the input electrons are by what
channel we have chosen, and therefore some are deflected down and some
are deflected up– we can no longer tell what their <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin is.<br />
<br />
The facts above, however, are presented to imply another question which
someone trying to cling onto classical common sense would reasonably
ask. It may be true that if we stand above the apparatus and only look
at detector readings we cannot tell which electrons have which spin when
we are passing all of them into the same magnetic field. However, if we
were to focus in on electrons one by one, tracking which electrons have
which spin, surely we could for example track the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> spins of each of the electrons passing
into the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> field and then each of
the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spins when they come out of
it: and thereby know the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spins simultaneously?<br />
<br />
Investigating this leads us to try and repeat the experiment with as few
electrons as possible. The first thing we realise, when doing so, is
that 10 electrons and <span class="math inline">\(10^8\)</span>
electrons exhibit the same types of phenomena when we study them, though
naturally the groups of electrons are different in quantity for the two
scenarios. In other words– intensity (a measure of the number of
electrons per unit area in the beam) does not affect the experiment.
Well this is good news, since that means we can reduce to single
electrons in our electron gun and once and for all understand the
phenomenon!<br />
<br />
All seems well. The first <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>
magnetic field, let’s say, gives the electron to have up spin. The
second <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> magnetic field, might give
a right spin. So we know both of the <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spins simultaneously, we think:
seemingly invalidating our quantum hypothesis that we could not do this.
To confirm, we put a new <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> magnetic
field to our up-right spin electron. And finally, we get a nasty shock,
because (sooner or later, if we repeat the single electron analysis
multiple times) the given electron which we measured to have up and then
right spin suddenly exhibits a downwards deflection, showing down
spin.<br />
<br />
<strong>This is the probabilistic state</strong>. We have already proved
that the magnetic fields cannot flip any spins, and only reveal the spin
in the relevant dimension where the magnet is set to. Yet this electron
has exhibited up and down spin in successive measurements. This leads us
to the only possible conclusion. Our overarching point: that an electron
cannot have a spin value at all times, must be true. This would be in
line with our other quantum hypothesis that we cannot know
simultaneously the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spins. The electron <em>cannot</em>
have a spin value at all times, and this means that there are times it
does not have a fixed spin value, and in particular we now know that
these times where the spin value cannot be known at least include all
the times when the spin value in another dimension is known.<br />
<br />
Why do electrons still get deflected, if they do not have spin values?
The logical explanation is the correct one this time: an electron might
not <em>have</em> a spin value, but it can <em>take</em> a spin value.
It turns out that it takes a spin value with specific probabilities,
which we will soon learn how to calculate. So what we achieved in the
first two measurements on this single electron: an up and right spin, is
simply a result of the electron taking some the up value for <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin with some probability (<span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> in our example) and then
taking the left value for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> spin
with some probability (also <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> in our example). However, if
we measure <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, then trying to measure <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin again results in a new
probabilistic trial: we <em>could</em> get up again, but we could also
get down this time. The <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin
measurement will be a completely new outcome when we try to measure it
again, and therefore we never did know the two spins
simultaneously!<br />
<br />
A few things are maintained in this world of chaos, fortunately. We
recall that applying the same magnetic field to an electron beam over
and over again gives the same spin every time. This would not be true if
for each magnet we were simply experiencing a probability of <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> that it exhibits up spin and
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> of down spin, since an
infinite sequence of magnetic fields would eventually of course invoke
that <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> probability of the
other spin to the one we are measuring every time. This therefore proves
that if we measure the spin of an electron it <em>takes</em> a state-
here, with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>
of taking an up spin state and <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> of taking a down spin state-
and stays in this state until we force it out of that measured state
with some type of action. The example we have seen for one type of
action which takes an electron out of the original state it has taken,
shockingly, is trying to measure its <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> spin. By measuring its <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> spin we force it into either a left or
right state (here, also with probabilities <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>), but also revert it into an
unmeasured state with respect to its <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin in the process of measuring its
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> spin.<br />
<br />
This term ‘unmeasured state’ is a clumsy denomination. Quantum
physicists came up instead with the term <strong>superposition</strong>
of states– literally, the idea of different possible states being added
onto each other to make a new state. Here, the superposition is of two
states (up and down in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin,
or left and right in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> spin).
However, if we were considering different observables with more than two
possibilities- such as position, which has infinite possibilities- then
we could have a superposition of infinite possible states. Of course,
some of these states in the superposition might have a greater
probability of being measured than others: which is why the idea of
superpositions and inherent probability are inextricably linked when we
are considering the states of quantum systems. Through our long proof by
contradiction, we have thus established that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A system may exist in a superposition of states.</p></li>
<li><p>A measurement on a system in a superposition forces it into one
of the possible states in that superposition.</p></li>
<li><p>There is some probability associated with forcing that
superposition into one of the constituent states.</p></li>
<li><p>There are certain observables, like <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> spin, which get in each other’s ways
when one tries to force a system out of the respective
superpositions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the next three chapters, the reason for these things
will all be clear.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This chapter is actually more of a pedagogical exercise than a strict
reportage of phenomena. That is why we kept offering false hypotheses
instead of the correct answer from the start. The point is that the
reader should get a feeling of classical mechanics and their own
intuition starting to fail, and the logical links we must make to try
and offer explanations for these strange quantum phenomena. The physical
set-up described in this chapter will, for the most part, be swept under
the rug, but the ideas it has introduced to the reader will on the other
hand be central. The most important two ideas, which the reader must
remember, especially for the next chapter, are superposition of states,
and inherent probabilities.<br />
<br />
These will provide good motivation for the mathematical innovations we
see in the next chapter, which will begin our journey of quantum
mechanics formally.</p>
